# Email Notification

## Description

Plugin for Omeka Classic. Once installed and active, system notifies specific recipients once a new Item and/or Collection is added.

Settings allow to choose who is receiving the notification, to customize the messages sent and whether the system should display information about the notification also for the user who just added the new Item and/or Collection.

## Installation
Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "SendNotification".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin.

## Warning
Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.

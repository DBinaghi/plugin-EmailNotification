# Send Notification

## Description

Plugin for Omeka Classic. Once installed and active, system notifies specific recipients once a new Item and/or Collection is added.

Settings allow to choose who is receiving the notification, to customize the messages sent and whether the system should display information about the notification also for the user who just added the new Item and/or Collection.
